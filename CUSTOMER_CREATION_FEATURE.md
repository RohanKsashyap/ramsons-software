# Customer Creation Feature

## Overview

The Ramsons Accounting application now includes an enhanced customer selection system that allows users to both select existing customers and create new customers directly within transaction forms (invoices, payments, sales). This eliminates the need to navigate away from the current form to create a new customer.

## Features

- **Real-time Search**: Type to search through existing customers
- **Multiple Search Fields**: Search by name, phone number, or email address
- **Instant Results**: Dropdown shows matching customers as you type
- **Clear Search**: Easy way to clear the search and start over

### ‚ûï **Quick Customer Creation**
- **One-Click Access**: "Create New Customer" button at the top of the dropdown
- **Minimal Required Fields**: Only customer name is required
- **Optional Information**: Phone, email, and address are optional
- **Instant Selection**: New customer is automatically selected after creation

### üîÑ **Seamless Integration**
- **All Forms Supported**: Works in invoices, payments, transactions, and sales
- **Real-time Updates**: Customer list updates immediately after creation
- **Consistent Experience**: Same interface across all forms
- **No Page Navigation**: Stay in the current form throughout the process

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### `CustomerSelector.tsx`
The main component that provides both search and creation functionality:

```typescript
interface CustomerSelectorProps {
  value: string;                    // Selected customer ID
  onChange: (customerId: string, customerData?: Partial<Customer>) => void;
  required?: boolean;               // Whether customer selection is required
  placeholder?: string;             // Placeholder text for search input
  className?: string;               // Additional CSS classes
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Search input with real-time filtering
- Dropdown with customer list and creation option
- Modal form for creating new customers
- Selected customer display with clear option

#### Updated Form Components
All transaction-related forms now use the `CustomerSelector`:

- **TransactionForm.tsx**: For sales and general transactions
- **InvoiceForm.tsx**: For creating invoices
- **PaymentForm.tsx**: For recording payments

### API Integration

The component integrates with the existing customer API:

```typescript
// Fetch existing customers
const response = await apiService.customers.getAll();

// Create new customer
const response = await apiService.customers.create({
  name: 'Customer Name',
  phone: '123-456-7890',    // Optional
  email: 'email@example.com', // Optional
  address: '123 Main St',   // Optional
  totalCredit: 0,
  totalPaid: 0,
  balance: 0
});
```

### State Management

The component manages several pieces of state:

```typescript
const [customers, setCustomers] = useState<Customer[]>([]);
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [showDropdown, setShowDropdown] = useState(false);
const [showNewCustomerForm, setShowNewCustomerForm] = useState(false);
const [newCustomerData, setNewCustomerData] = useState({
  name: '',
  phone: '',
  email: '',
  address: ''
});
const [creatingCustomer, setCreatingCustomer] = useState(false);
```

## User Experience
